More recent changes are at the end.

April 8, 1996.  Prime AC paramodulation requires a lot of time to check
if substitutions are simplifiable, mostly because the set of demodulators
is large.  Try the following: keep a separate set of demodulators,
upt to weight=10, and use that instead.  Results slightly positive,
several speedups of about 1.5.  Option removed from ntp, because
implementation is ugly, and it will be hard to decide what vlaue to use.

April 11, 1996.  Checked use of ac_canonical.  Removed call at start
of process_clause.  Worked on basic AC paramodulation.

April 12, 1996.  Reworked basic paramodulation.  See basic.doc

April 15--16, 1996.  Added semantic paramodulation.

April 23-24, 1996.  Worked on semantic paramod.  Results mixed.

April 25, 1996. Worked on (kludgey fixed) problem of very slow FPA delete.
New flag fpa_delete (NOTE: default is clear, i.e., kludgey fix):
If clear, don't delete terms in disabled clauses from FPA lists.
(When retrieving, skip disabled terms.)  I think the culprits are
lists like [+] in the back demod FPA list; these can get very big.
But they aren't used much, so having disabled terms in them doesn't
hurt.  Remember this kludge if we ever "really delete" clauses.

April 26, 1996. pick_given_ratio for para_pairs.  Found clean
and efficient solution.  Interesting experiments on AC-ratio.

--------------------------------------------

I failed to log changes for a long time.  The experiments for
"33 basic test .." paper were conducted.  The papers was written.

June 26, 1996.  EQP 0.9 was made made avaible on the web, in
association  with the paper.

Again, I failed to log a few changes.

Feb 1997.  I made a change (don't remember what);  the result is EQP 0.9a.

October 21, 1997.  EQP made an unsound inference.  Bug in
	backtrack unification (in btu.c).  Fixed.
	Reran Robbins m5-60b job.  Identical search.
	Reran ortholattice jobs (E2, E3).  Identical searches.

	Result is EQP 0.9c.

October 24, 1997.  Replace Web version 0.9 with this one 0.9c.

Feb 3, 1998.  In definition on next_combo_a1, change 100 to MAX_BASIS.
	(MAX_BASIS is defined to be 100, so this should have no effect.

Apr 10, 1998.  Discovered paramodulation bug while writing OPS.  When
	recursively paramodulating into an AC term, I was going into
	all AC subterms.  We should be going into the top only.
	This caused redundant inferences.  Fixed.  (by mimicking AC
	Demodulation, which handled the situation correctly.)
	
        Result is EQP 0.9d.

-----------------------------------------------

May 12, 2009.  Geoff Sutcliffe asked for a small change in the proof
	output: put an empty clause at the end of the proof.

	Also, a few very minor changes to eliminate compiler warnings.

	Result is EQP 0.9e.
