Basic Paramodulation.

Do not allow paramodulation into terms that were introduced
by instantiation of variables.  Demodulation is problematic;
see below.

1. "Nonbasic" terms are those introduced by instantiation;
These terms inadmissible "into" terms.  (Variables also are
inadmissible.)

2. When a term is introduced by instantiation, its root
and all of its subterms are given a "nonbasic mark".  The terms
are inadmissible.

3. Input clauses have no marks.  The marks are introduced by
apply_basic(), and they are are copied by apply_basic(),
apply_substitute(), when copying clauses for flip and back demod.

6. Paramodulation.  Never into terms with nonbasic marks.
However, subterms of nonbasic terms are considered (e.g., indexed
and traversed).  A nonbasic term can have basic subterms
(which seems contradictory), because all terms are demodulated,
and contracta can have basic terms.

4. Subsumption. When a clause is deleted by forward subsumption the
subsumee might be more basic than the subsumer; in this case, some of
the nonbasic marks have to be removed from the subsumer.  If the
subsumer has a mark that does not occur in the corresponding position
of the sumsumee, the subsumer's mark is removed.  There is a problem
if any AC symbols are present, because corresponding terms might not
be in corresponding positions; therefore, to be safe, all of the
nonbasic marks of the subsumer are removed.

5. Demodulation.  Nonbasic marks never prevent demodulation
(contrary to the completeness and theoretical studies).
When a term is rewritten (including nonbasic terms), the
contractum never gets any nonbasic marks.
